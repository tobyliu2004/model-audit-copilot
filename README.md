# Model Audit Copilot

**Model Audit Copilot** is an open-source, modular toolkit designed to evaluate and monitor the integrity, fairness, and stability of machine learning pipelines. It provides a developer-first auditing suite to detect drift, explain predictions, audit fairness, validate schema consistency, and flag data leakage or pipeline anomalies—integrating seamlessly into existing ML workflows.

This project is aimed at advancing responsible AI deployment by offering practical tools to surface hidden risks and ensure trustworthy model behavior, especially in production environments.

## Features

Model Audit Copilot includes the following core auditing capabilities:

### 1. Drift Detection
- Detect covariate drift between datasets (e.g., production vs training).
- Statistical methods: KS test, Population Stability Index (PSI), Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD).
- Visualizations of distributional change and feature-wise drift magnitudes.

### 2. Fairness Auditing
- Analyze group fairness metrics across protected attributes (e.g., race, gender, age).
- Group-specific performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, accuracy).
- Built-in support for reweighing and bias-aware evaluations.

### 3. Explainability
- Global and local explainability using SHAP values.
- Visual tools for feature importance, dependence, and individual explanations.

### 4. Data and Target Leakage Detection
- Identify potential data and target leakage using correlation and data trace heuristics.
- Optional hooks for model training pipelines to validate leakage pre-deployment.

### 5. Training–Serving Skew Analysis
- Compare feature statistics and encoding mappings between training and production data pipelines.

### 6. Schema & Consistency Validator
- Automated schema diffing for features, data types, and missing value patterns.
- Validates feature presence, value ranges, and type alignment.

### 7. Outlier and Anomaly Detection
- Unsupervised outlier scoring using Isolation Forests, LOF, or clustering-based anomaly detectors.
- Pluggable into batch or real-time monitoring workflows.

## Usage

Each module can be run independently or integrated into a full audit pipeline. A typical drift check workflow:

```python
from copilot.drift import drift_detector

results = drift_detector.compare_datasets(
    reference_df=train_data,
    current_df=prod_data,
    method='ks'
)

results.plot_summary()
```

The project also includes:

- Prebuilt CLI tools for batch audits  
- A Streamlit dashboard for visualizing drift, fairness, and model explanations  
- Hooks for integrating with training pipelines or CI workflows

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn  
- SHAP for explainability  
- Streamlit for dashboard  
- pytest for unit testing  
- Optuna (optional) for hyperparameter sensitivity analysis  
- GitHub Actions (CI testing)  
- Docker (optional containerization)
